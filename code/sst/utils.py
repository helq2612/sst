    """Convert predicted output tensor (y_pred) from SST model into the
    corresponding temporal proposals. Can perform standard confidence
    thresholding/post-processing (e.g. non-maximum suppression) to select
    the top proposals afterwards.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : ndarray
        Predicted output from SST model of size (L, K), where L is the length of
        the input video in terms of discrete time steps.
    delta : int, optional
        The temporal resolution of the visual encoder in terms of frames. See
        Section 3 of the main paper for additional details.

    Returns
    -------
    props : ndarray
        Two-dimensional array of shape (num_props, 2), containing the start and
        end boundaries of the temporal proposals in units of frames.
