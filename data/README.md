### Data folder (`data/`)

As part of the supplementary, we provide pre-trained model parameters (`params/`) and example proposals (`proposals/`).
Video files for the [THUMOS'14](http://crcv.ucf.edu/THUMOS14/) and [ActivityNet](http://activity-net.org) benchmarks can be found on their corresponding challenge websites.
Example features from the visual encoder will be released soon.
To obtain all released files, please run the download scripts in each sub-folder.
