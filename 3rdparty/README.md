### 3rd party folder (`3rdparty/`)

This folder is where we keep our third-party resources. In particular, we clone the [C3D repo](https://github.com/facebook/C3D), leveraging *C3D v1.0* as the basis for the SST visual encoder for the original paper. You may also wish to include any other third party repositories for action classification (on top of the proposals) in this folder.

**Important:** Be sure to cite the appropriate 3rd party repositories and papers as well if you utilize them, keeping in mind any license details they may have.
